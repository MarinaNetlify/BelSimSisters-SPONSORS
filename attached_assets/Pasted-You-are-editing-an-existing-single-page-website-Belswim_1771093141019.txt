You are editing an existing single-page website (Belswimsisters / English Channel relay). Implement the following changes. Keep the current design style unless specified.

1) Language buttons (no translation logic yet)
- Add two small buttons “RU” and “BY” in the top navigation (top-right).
- Buttons should be visible on all screen sizes.
- No language switching behavior required yet (just UI).
- Style: transparent background, white border, white text, subtle hover.

2) Section: THE MISSION
- In the hero/mission area where it says:
  “SIX WOMEN. ONE MISSION. CROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AS A RELAY TEAM.”
  there is a strange background effect/image behind the text.
- Remove that weird background effect for this section (remove background image/pattern/overlay or pseudo-element). Keep the section clean and readable.

- Replace the mission copy with:

Headline remains:
“SIX WOMEN. ONE MISSION. CROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AS A RELAY TEAM.”

Replace body text with:
“No wetsuits. No shortcuts. Just grit, cold water, and an unbreakable bond.
We are Belswimsisters. We will be the first Belarusians to cross the English Channel.”

(Keep line breaks nicely formatted on desktop and mobile.)

3) Section: THE CHALLENGE
- Wherever it currently says “1 TEAM”, change it to “6 GIRLS”.
- Keep the same typography and layout.

4) Section: THE TEAM
- Update the team list to include exactly these names + locations:

— Maryna Shynkarenka — London, United Kingdom
— Ulyana Zarubina — Laguna Niguel, USA
— Alena Hryhoryeva — Sarasota, USA
— Darya Slizh — Vilnius, Lithuania
— Anastasia Litvinenko — Vilnius, Lithuania
— Maryia Kolesava-Hudzilina — Vilnius, Lithuania

Add a subsection title:
“Head of Support:”
Then add:
— Yury Yurchanka — Warsaw, Poland

Match existing team list styling (cards or list). Keep spacing clean.

5) Section: VISIBILITY PLAN
- Keep the existing timeline layout/format, but replace the timeline text with a shorter plan based on the following (use English, concise):

Title: “Where and how we’ll show up (by June 2026)”
Timeline items (3–5 items max, grouped):

Digital:
• personal Instagram accounts
• team Instagram
• Telegram, LinkedIn, TikTok
• live broadcast from the boat

Media:
• independent Belarusian media
• international publications
• sports media & blogs
• reposts by well-known Belarusian public figures

Community:
• offline diaspora meetups
• founder community talks
• swim/sport events

Final line (as the last timeline highlight):
“Climax: the June 2026 Channel crossing and the final media peak.”

6) Section: BE PART OF HISTORY
- Change CONTACT email from “HELLO@BELSWIMSISTERS.COM” to:
romanovich.m.a@gmail.com

- Change CTA button text from “JOIN THE MISSION” to “WATCH US”
- Update the CTA link to:
https://www.instagram.com/belswimsisters/
- Make sure it opens in a new tab (target=_blank) and keeps same button style.

After changes:
- Run and verify there are no broken layouts on mobile.
- Keep all existing animations and styling unless required to remove the weird background in THE MISSION.
