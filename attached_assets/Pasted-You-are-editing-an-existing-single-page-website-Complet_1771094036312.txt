Subsection Title:
4. Our Audience

Content:

Belswimsisters is not a niche sports project.

It is a cross-border media story with cultural, professional and community reach.

Our project connects with:

• The international Belarusian diaspora (UK, EU, US)
• IT & founders communities
• Entrepreneurs and career-driven professionals
• The endurance sports audience
• Followers of well-known Belarusian artists, athletes and public figures
• Women’s leadership communities

We are intentionally building bridges between sport, business, culture and identity.

This is not just about swimming.
It’s about representation, resilience and visibility.

Subsection Title:
5. Where & How We Show Up

• Live broadcast from the escort boat during the Channel crossing

Media:
• Independent Belarusian media outlets

6. What the Company Receives

Partnering with Belswimsisters is not logo placement.
It is strategic integration into a historic international project with strong values and narrative depth.

Subsection:
Brand Visibility

• Swim caps during the Channel crossing
• Swimsuits
• Dryrobes and team merchandise
• Training apparel
• Towels and official materials

The brand becomes part of the project’s visual identity throughout preparation and during the crossing itself.

Subsection:
Digital & Content Integration

• Team Instagram and personal athlete accounts
• TikTok preparation content
• LinkedIn (professional audience)
• Telegram
• Live broadcast from the escort boat
• Photo & video materials
• Final documentary-style content after the crossing

Add sentence:

Subsection:
Reputational Value

The partner is associated with:

• The first Belarusian women’s attempt to cross the English Channel
• Discipline and long-term preparation
• International ambition
• Initiative and leadership

Final closing lines:

This is not a campaign.
It is a reputational asset.

The project speaks directly to decision-makers, founders, ambitious professionals and globally mobile communities — an audience where resilience, strategy and courage are deeply valued.
